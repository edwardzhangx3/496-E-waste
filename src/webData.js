Computers, mobile devices, televisions, sound systems, chargers and even household appliances are all recyclable, yet they can also be the most dangerous materials dumped inside a landfill, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. We hope we can let people take actions of recycling e-waste. In addition, we will provide appropriate methods and professional channels to handle this problem. As a college club, we wish we can help college students to realize the importance of e-waste recyling. We will have incoming online/offline activities. Please follow as from the social medias we attached on this page. Thanks!"

        "content":"E-waste is a popular, informal name for electronic products nearing the end of their useful life. Computers, televisions, VCRs, stereos, copiers, and fax machines are common electronic products. The vast majority of e-waste can be reused, refurbished, scrapped for parts, or recycled. However, in the US, only 20% of Americans properly dispose of their e-waste, and only a fraction of that 20% that is properly disposed of is recycled or reused within the US.5 Ideally, proper disposal of e-waste would take place in factories where recycling is undertaken by machines with proper environmental regulations and procedures to protect workers and the local environment from exposure to harmful materials and pollutants. Often, however, that isn't the case.",
