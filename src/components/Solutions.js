							<h4>Policy</h4>
							<p> Over the past three decades, numerous policies have been developed to stem the flow of e-waste to developing countries and to ensure proper processing. The Basel Convention on the Control of the Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal, adopted in 1989, was developed in response to numerous scandals surrounding the international trafficking of hazardous waste in the 1980s. The convention has been signed by 182 nations and the European Union (EU).The Basel convention applies to hazardous waste, requires exporters to notify and obtain permission to ship waste to another country, and encourages overall waste reduction. Although the United States is the world's largest source of e-waste, it is one of the only countries to refuse to ratify the Basel convention. Although there are rules specifically for the trade in hazardous wastes, the Basel convention is often criticized as ineffective because it does not ban the export of all hazardous wastes, its notification system is poorly enforced and there are no penalties for non-compliance.

							<h4>US Policy</h4>
							<p> There is currently no federal legislation in the U.S. that mandates the recycling of e-waste. Some states in the U.S. allow businesses and individuals to throw their used electronics in the trash; however, many states are beginning to mandate environmental responsibility by banning the disposal of e-waste into landfills. National Strategy for Electronic Stewardship: Federal agencies must reuse (other agencies), donate (schools, non-profits, local governments), resell, or recycle. Cannot send to landfills or incinerators.
								Recycling center must be certified by R2(responsible recycling practices) or e-Stewards
							</p>
							<p>
								Included: Phones, computers, monitors, televisions, copy machines, fax machines, small metering
								devices (made with rare/precious metals, plastic, glass, some toxic materials)
							</p>
